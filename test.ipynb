We propose an interpretable Bayesian inference approach that centres on variational inference methods. We implement a Poisson model to capture occurrences of event types, from which we infer player abilities. Our approach also allows the visualisation of differences between players, for a specific ability, through the marginal posterior variational densities. We then use these inferred player abilities to extend the Bayesian hierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010), which captures a team’s scoring rate (the rate at which they score goals). We apply the resulting scheme to the English Premier League, capturing player abilities over the 2013/2014 season, before using output from the hierarchical model to predict whether over or under 2.5 goals will be scored in a given fixture or not in the 2014/2015 season.\"\n",

      "IntroductionWithin this paper we look to determine the ability of those playerswho play in the English Premier League. The Premier League is anannual soccer league established in 1992 and is the mostwatched soccer league in the world (Yueh, 2014; Curley and Roeder, 2016).It is made up of 20 teams, who, over the course of a season, play everyother team twice (both home and away), giving a total of 380 fixtureseach year. It is the top division of English soccer, and every yearthe bottom 3 teams are relegated to be replaced by 3 teams from thenext division down (the Championship). In recent times the PremierLeague has also become known as the richest league in the world(Deloitte, 2016), through both foreign investment and alucrative deal for television rights (Cave and Miller, 2016; Rumsby, 2016; BBC Business, 2016).Whilst there is growing financial competition from China, the Premierleague arguably still attracts some of the best players in the world.Staying in the Premier league (by avoiding relegation) is worth alarge amount of money, therefore teams are looking for any advantagewhen accessing a player’s ability to ensure they sign the best players.With (enormously) large sums of money spent to buy/transfer theseplayers, it is natural to ask “How good are they at a specific skill,for example, passing a ball, scoring a goal or making a tackle?”Here, we present a method to access this ability, whilst quantifyingthe uncertainty around any given player.The statistical modelling of sports has become a topic of increasinginterest in recent times, as more data is collected on the sports welove, coupled with a heightened interest in the outcome of thesesports, that is, the continuous rise of online betting. Soccer isproviding an area of rich research, with the ability to capture thegoals scored in a match being of particular interest. Reep et al. (1971)used a negative binomial distribution to model the aggregate goalcounts, before Maher (1982) used independent Poisson distributionsto capture the goals scored by competing teams on a game by game basis.Dixon and Coles (1997) also used the Poisson distribution to model scores,however they departed from the assumption of independence; the modelis extended in Dixon and Robinson (1998). The model of Dixon and Coles (1997) isalso built upon in Karlis and Ntzoufras (2000, 2003), who inflate theprobability of a draw. Baio and Blangiardo (2010) consider this model in theBayesian paradigm, implementing a Bayesian hierarchical model forgoals scored by each team in a match. Other works to investigate themodelling of soccer scores include (Lee, 1997; Joseph et al., 2006; Karlis and Ntzoufras, 2009).A player performance rating system (the EA Sports Player PerformanceIndex) is developed by McHale et al. (2012). The rating system isdeveloped in conjunction with the English Premier League, the EnglishFootball League, Football DataCo and the Press Association, and aimsto represent a player’s worth in a single number. There is some debatewithin the soccer community on the weightings derived in the paper,and as McHale et al. (2012) point out, the players who play for the bestteams lead the index. There is also some questions raised as to whetherreducing the rating to a single number (whilst easy to understand),masks a player’s ability in a certain skill, whether good or bad.Finally, as mentioned by the authors, the rating system does nothandle those players who sustain injuries (and therefore have littleplaying time) well. McHale and Szczepański (2014) attempt to identify the goalscoring ability of players. Spatial methods to capture a team’sstyle/behaviour are explored in Lucey et al. (2013),Bialkowski et al. (2014) and Bojinov and Bornn (2016). Here, our interestlies in defining that player ability, addressing some of the issuesraised by McHale et al. (2012), before attempting to capture thegoals scored in a game, taking into account these abilities.To infer player abilities we appeal to variational inference (VI)methods, an alternative strategy to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)sampling, which can be advantageous to use when datasets are largeand/or models have high complexity. Popularised in the machine learningliterature (Jordan et al., 1999; Wainwright and Jordan, 2008),VI transforms the problem of approximate posterior inference into anoptimisation problem, meaning it is easier to scale to large data andtends to be faster than MCMC. Some application areas and indicativereferences where VI has been used includesports (Kitani et al., 2011; Ruiz and Perez-Cruz, 2015; Franks et al., 2015),computational biology (Jojic et al., 2004; Stegle et al., 2010; Carbonetto and Stephens, 2012; Raj et al., 2014),computer vision (Bishop and Winn, 2000; Likas and Galatsanos, 2004; Blei and Jordan, 2006; Cummins and Newman, 2008; Sudderth and Jordan, 2009; Du et al., 2009)and language processing (Reyes-Gomez et al., 2004; Wang and Blunsom, 2013; Yogatama et al., 2014).For a discussion on VI techniques as a whole, see Blei et al. (2017) andthe references therein.The remainder of this article is organised as follows. The data ispresented in Section 2. In Section 3 we outline ourmodel to define player abilities before discussing a variationalinference approach; we finish the section by offering our extensionto the Bayesian hierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010). Applicationsare considered in Section 4 and a discussion is provided inSection 5.2 The dataThe data available to us is a collection of touch-by-touch data, whichrecords every touch in a given fixture, noting the time, team, player,type of event and outcome. A section of the data is shown intable 1. The data covers the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015English Premier League seasons, and consists of roughly1.2 million events in total, which equates to approximately 1600 foreach fixture in the dataset. There are 39 event types in the dataset,which we listin table 2. The nature of most of these event types isself-explanatory, that is, Goal indicates that a player scored a goalat that event time. Throughout this paper we will mainly concernourselves with event types which are self-evident, and will define themore subtle event types as and when needed.minutesecondperiodteam idplayer idtypeoutcome01FirstHalf66391242PassSuccessful02FirstHalf66323736PassSuccessful03FirstHalf66317PassSuccessful04FirstHalf66314230PassSuccessful05FirstHalf6637398PassSuccessful06FirstHalf66331451PassSuccessful09FirstHalf6637398PassSuccessful010FirstHalf69038772TackleSuccessful010FirstHalf66380767DispossessedSuccessful012FirstHalf6908505PassSuccessfulTable 1: A section of the touch-by-touch data.StopControlDisruptionMiscellaneaCardAerialBlockedPassCornerAwardedEndBallRecoveryChallengeCrossNotClaimedFormationChangeBallTouchClaimKeeperSweeperFormationSetChanceMissedClearanceShieldBallOppOffsideGivenDispossessedInterceptionPenaltyFacedErrorKeeperPickupStartFoulOffsideProvokedSubstitutionOffGoalPunchSubstitutionOnGoodSkillSaveMissedShotsSmotherOffsidePassTacklePassSavedShotShotOnPostTakeOnTable 2: Event types contained within the data.We can split the event types into 4 categories.1. Stop: An event corresponding to a stoppage in play suchas a substitution or offside decision.2. Control: An event where a team is perceived to be incontrol of the ball, these are mainly seen as attacking events.3. Disruption: An event where a team is perceived to bedisrupting the current play within a game, these can generally be seenas defensive events.4. Unclear: These events could be classified in any of theother three categories.In this paper we are interested in those events which correspond to aplayer during active game-play, hence we remove Stop events from thedata. Instead we focus on those event types categorised as eitherControl or Disruption, or, when a team is attempting to score agoal and when a team is attempting to stop the opposition from scoringa goal respectively.It should be noted that OffsideGiven is the inverse of OffsideProvokedand as such we remove one of these events from the data. Henceforth, itis assumed that the event type OffsideGiven is removed from thedata, rewarding the defensive side for provoking an offside throughOffsideProvoked. The frequency of each event type (after removing Pass)during the Liverpool vs Stoke match, which occurred on the 17th August2013, is shown in figure 1. The match is typical of anyfixture within in the dataset. Pass dominates the data over all otherevent types recorded, with a ratio of approximately 10:1 to BallRecovery,and hence is removed for clarity. This is not surprising given the makeup of a soccer match (where teams mainly pass the ball).Figure 1: Frequency of each event type observed in the Liverpool vsStoke 2013/2014 English Premier League match, 17th August 2013.The event type Pass is removed for clarity, it occurs with aratio of approximately 10:1 over BallRecovery.In determining a player’s ability for a given event type we make theassumption that the more times a player is involved, the better theyare at that event type; for example, a player who makes more passesthan another player is assumed to be the better passer. On this basis,we can transform the data displayed in table 1 torepresent the number of each event type each player is involved in, ata fixture by fixture level. This count data is illustrated intable 3. It is to this data, which the methods ofSection 3 will be applied.Count for each event typefixture idplayer idteam idGoalPassTackle...1483412176630973148341238176630373148341245746630733⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮148383110136676136414838311226767604501483831123786760522⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮⋮Table 3: A section of the count data derived from the data of table 1.3 Bayesian inferenceConsider the case where we have KKKitalic_K matches, numbered k=1,...,Kk1...Kk=1,\\ldots,Kitalic_k = 1 , ... , K.We denote the set of teams in fixture kkkitalic_k as TksubscriptTkT_{k}T k , with TkHsuperscriptsubscriptTkHT_{k}^{H}T k H andTkAsuperscriptsubscriptTkAT_{k}^{A}T k A representing the home and away teams respectively.

For simplicity,we describe the model for a single pair of event types which are deemedto interact, for example, Pass and Interception, we denote these eventtypes e1subscripte1e_{1}e 1 and e2subscripte2e_{2}e 2 , such that E={e1,e2}Esubscripte1subscripte2E=\\{e_{1},e_{2}\\}E = { e 1 , e 2 }.Taking Xi,kesuperscriptsubscriptXikeX_{i,k}^{e}X i , k e as the number of occurrences (counts) of eventtype eeeitalic_e, by player iiiitalic_i (who plays for team jjjitalic_j), in match kkkitalic_k, we haveXi,ke∼P⁢o⁢i⁢s⁢(ηi,ke⁢τi,k),similar-tosuperscriptsubscriptXikePoissuperscriptsubscriptηikesubscriptτikX_{i,k}^{e}\\sim Pois\\left(\\eta_{i,k}^{e}\\tau_{i,k}\\right),X i , k e ∼ P o i s ( italic_η i , k e italic_τ i , k ) ,(1)whereηi,ke=exp⁡{Δie+τi,k⁢(λ1e⁢∑i′∈PkjΔi′e-λ2e⁢∑i′∈PkTk∖jΔi′E∖e)+(δTkH,j)⁢γe},superscriptsubscriptηikesuperscriptsubscriptΔiesubscriptτiksuperscriptsubscriptλ1esubscriptsuperscripti′superscriptsubscriptPkjsuperscriptsubscriptΔsuperscripti′esuperscriptsubscriptλ2esubscriptsuperscripti′superscriptsubscriptPksubscriptTkjsuperscriptsubscriptΔsuperscripti′EesubscriptδsuperscriptsubscriptTkHjsuperscriptγe\\eta_{i,k}^{e}=\\exp\\left\\{\\Delta_{i}^{e}+\\tau_{i,k}\\left(\\lambda_{1}^{e}\\sum_{%i^{\\prime}\\in P_{k}^{j}}\\Delta_{i^{\\prime}}^{e}-\\lambda_{2}^{e}\\sum_{i^{\\prime%}\\in P_{k}^{T_{k}\\setminus j}}\\Delta_{i^{\\prime}}^{E\\setminus e}\\right)+\\left(%\\delta_{T_{k}^{H},j}\\right)\\gamma^{\\,e}\\right\\},italic_η i , k e = exp { Δ i e + italic_τ i , k ( italic_λ 1 e ∑ i ′ ∈ P k j Δ i ′ e - italic_λ 2 e ∑ i ′ ∈ P k T k ∖ j Δ i ′ E ∖ e ) + ( italic_δ T k H , j ) italic_γ e } ,(2)δr,ssubscriptδrs\\delta_{r,s}italic_δ r , s is the Kronecker delta and τi,ksubscriptτik\\tau_{i,k}italic_τ i , k is thefraction of time player iiiitalic_i (playing for team jjjitalic_j), spent on the pitchin match kkkitalic_k, with τi,k∈[0,1]subscriptτik01\\tau_{i,k}\\in[0,1]italic_τ i , k ∈ [ 0 , 1 ].

For ease we assume that only 11 players play for each team in the fixture (that is, we ignore substitutions) and suppress the time dependence (ττ\\tauitalic_τ).Interest lies in estimating this model using a Bayesian approach. Weput independent Gaussian priors over all abilities, whilst treatingthe remaining unknown parameters as hyperparameters — to be fittedby the marginal likelihood function. Given the size of the data andthe number of parameters needing to be estimated to fitequation 3, we appeal to variational inference techniques,which are the subject of the next section.3.1 Variational inferenceFor a general introduction to variational inference (VI) methods we direct the reader toBlei et al. (2017) (and the references therein). Variational inference ispaired with automatic differentiation in Kucukelbir et al. (2016),leading to a technique known as automatic differentiation variationalinference (ADVI). ADVI provides an automated solution to VI and isbuilt upon recent approaches in black-box VI, see(Ranganath et al., 2014; Mnih and Gregor, 2014; Kingma and Welling, 2014). Duvenaud and Adams (2015)present some Python code (5 lines) for implementing black-boxVI. A good overview to VI can be found in Chapter 19 ofGoodfellow et al. (2016). Given the set-up of the model above though, itis sufficient within this paper, to require only standardvariational inference methods. We briefly outline these below, andrefer the reader to Blei et al. (2017) for a more complete derivation.In contrast to some other techniques for Bayesian inference, such asMCMC, in VI we specify a variational family of densities over thelatent variables (νν\\nuitalic_ν). We then aim to find the best candidateapproximation, q⁢(ν)qνq(\\nu)q ( italic_ν ), to minimise the Kullback-Leibler (KL)divergence to the posteriorν*=argmin KLν{q(ν)||π(ν|x)},fragmentssuperscriptννargmin KLfragments{qfragments(ν)||πfragments(ν|x)},\\nu^{*}=\\underset{\\nu}{\\textrm{argmin KL}}\\left\\{q(\\nu)||\\pi(\\nu|x)\\right\\},italic_ν * = underitalic_ν argmin KL { q ( italic_ν ) | | italic_π ( italic_ν | x ) } ,where xxxitalic_x denotes the data.Unfortunately, due to the analytic intractability of the posteriordistribution, the KL divergence is not available in closed (analytic)form. However, it is possible to maximise the evidence lower bound(ELBO). The ELBO is the expectation of the joint density under theapproximation minus the entropy of the variational density and isgiven byELBO⁢(ν)=Eν⁢[log⁡{π⁢(ν,x)}]-Eν⁢[log⁡{q⁢(ν)}].ELBOνsubscriptEνdelimited-[]πνxsubscriptEνdelimited-[]qν\\textrm{ELBO}(\\nu)=\\textrm{E}_{\\nu}\\left[\\log\\left\\{\\pi\\left(\\nu,x\\right)%\\right\\}\\right]-\\textrm{E}_{\\nu}\\left[\\log\\left\\{q\\left(\\nu\\right)\\right\\}%\\right].ELBO ( italic_ν ) = E italic_ν [ log { italic_π ( italic_ν , x ) } ] - E italic_ν [ log { q ( italic_ν ) } ] .(4)The ELBO is the equivalent of the negative KL divergence up to theconstant log⁡{π⁢(x)}πx\\log\\{\\pi(x)\\}log { italic_π ( x ) }, and from Jordan et al. (1999) andBishop (2006) we know that, by maximising the ELBO we minimisethe KL divergence.In performing VI, assumptions must be made about the variationalfamily to which q⁢(ν)qνq(\\nu)q ( italic_ν ) belongs. Here we consider the mean-fieldvariational family, in which the latent variables are assumed to bemutually independent. Moreover, each latent variable νrsubscriptνr\\nu_{r}italic_ν r isgoverned by its own variational parameters (φrsubscriptitalic-φr\\phi_{r}italic_φ r ), which determineνrsubscriptνr\\nu_{r}italic_ν r ’s variational factor, the density q⁢(νr|φr)qconditionalsubscriptνrsubscriptitalic-φrq(\\nu_{r}|\\phi_{r})q ( italic_ν r | italic_φ r ).Specifically, for RRRitalic_R latent variablesq⁢(ν|φ)=∏r=1Rqr⁢(νr|φr).qconditionalνitalic-φsuperscriptsubscriptproductr1Rsubscriptqrconditionalsubscriptνrsubscriptitalic-φrq\\left(\\nu|\\phi\\right)=\\prod_{r=1}^{R}q_{r}\\left(\\nu_{r}|\\phi_{r}\\right).q ( italic_ν | italic_φ ) = ∏ r = 1 R q r ( italic_ν r | italic_φ r ) .(5)We note that the complexity of the variational family determines thecomplexity of the optimisation, and hence impacts the computationalcost of any VI approach. In general, it is possible to impose anygraphical structure on q⁢(νr|φr)qconditionalsubscriptνrsubscriptitalic-φrq(\\nu_{r}|\\phi_{r})q ( italic_ν r | italic_φ r ); a fully generalgraphical approach leads to structured variational inference, seeSaul and Jordan (1996). Furthermore, the data (xxxitalic_x) does not feature inequation 5, meaning the variational family is not amodel of the observed data; it is in fact the ELBO which connects thevariational density, q⁢(ν|φ)qconditionalνitalic-φq(\\nu|\\phi)q ( italic_ν | italic_φ ), to the data and the model.For the model outlined at the beginning of this section, letν=ΔνΔ\\nu=\\Deltaitalic_ν = Δ, and setq⁢(Δie|φie)∼N⁢(μΔie,σΔie2).similar-toqconditionalsuperscriptsubscriptΔiesuperscriptsubscriptitalic-φieNsubscriptμsuperscriptsubscriptΔiesuperscriptsubscriptσsuperscriptsubscriptΔie2q\\left(\\Delta_{i}^{e}|\\phi_{i}^{e}\\right)\\sim N\\left(\\mu_{\\Delta_{i}^{e}},%\\sigma_{\\Delta_{i}^{e}}^{2}\\right).q ( Δ i e | italic_φ i e ) ∼ N ( italic_μ Δ i e , italic_σ Δ i e 2 ) .(6)Our aim is to find suitable candidate values for the variationalparametersφie=(μΔie,σΔie)T,∀i,∀e.superscriptsubscriptitalic-φiesuperscriptsubscriptμsuperscriptsubscriptΔiesubscriptσsuperscriptsubscriptΔieTfor-allifor-alle\\phi_{i}^{e}=\\left(\\mu_{\\Delta_{i}^{e}},\\sigma_{\\Delta_{i}^{e}}\\right)^{T},%\\qquad\\forall i,\\forall e.italic_φ i e = ( italic_μ Δ i e , italic_σ Δ i e ) T , ∀ i , ∀ e .Explicitly q⁢(Δ|φ)qconditionalΔitalic-φq\\left(\\Delta|\\phi\\right)q ( Δ | italic_φ ) follows (5).Whenceq⁢(Δ|φ)=∏e∈E∏j∈T∏i∈Pjq⁢(Δie|φie),qconditionalΔitalic-φsubscriptproducteEsubscriptproductjTsubscriptproductisuperscriptPjqconditionalsuperscriptsubscriptΔiesuperscriptsubscriptitalic-φieq\\left(\\Delta|\\phi\\right)=\\prod_{e\\in E}\\prod_{j\\in T}\\prod_{i\\in P^{j}}q\\left%(\\Delta_{i}^{e}|\\phi_{i}^{e}\\right),q ( Δ | italic_φ ) = ∏ e ∈ E ∏ j ∈ T ∏ i ∈ P j q ( Δ i e | italic_φ i e ) ,(7)where TTTitalic_T is the set of all teams and PjsuperscriptPjP^{j}P j are the players who playfor team jjjitalic_j.

We do however incorporate thetechniques of automatic differentiation for computational ease, anduse the Python package autograd (Maclaurin et al., 2015)to fit the model.3.2 Hierarchical modelBuilding on the methods of Section 3.1, we wish todiscover whether the inferred ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δs have any impact on ourability to predict the goals scored in a soccer match. As abaseline model we consider the work of Baio and Blangiardo (2010), who presentthe model of Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003) in a Bayesian framework. The model hasclose ties with (Dixon and Coles, 1997; Lee, 1997; Karlis and Ntzoufras, 2000) which haveall previously been used to predict soccer scores. We first brieflyoutline the model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010), before offering our extensionto include the imputed ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δs.The model is a Poisson-log normal model, see for exampleAitchison and Ho (1989), Chib and Winkelmann (2001) or Tunaru (2002) (amongstothers). For a particular fixture kkkitalic_k, we let yk=(yhk,yak)TsuperscriptyksuperscriptsubscriptsuperscriptykhsubscriptsuperscriptykaTy^{k}=(y^{k}_{h},y^{k}_{a})^{T}y k = ( y k h , y k a ) T be the total number of goals scored, where yhksubscriptsuperscriptykhy^{k}_{h}y k h is the number ofgoals scored by the home team, and yaksubscriptsuperscriptykay^{k}_{a}y k a , the number by the awayteam. Inherently, we let hhhitalic_h denote the home team and aaaitalic_a the awayteam for the given fixture kkkitalic_k. The goals of each team are modelled byindependent Poisson distributions, such thatytk|θt⁢∼i⁢n⁢d⁢e⁢p⁢P⁢o⁢i⁢s⁢(θt),t∈{h,a},conditionalsuperscriptsubscriptytksubscriptθtindepsimilar-toPoissubscriptθtthay_{t}^{k}|\\theta_{t}\\overset{indep}{\\sim}Pois\\left(\\theta_{t}\\right),\\qquad t%\\in\\{h,a\\},y t k | italic_θ t i n d e p ∼ P o i s ( italic_θ t ) , t ∈ { h , a } ,(9)wherelog⁡(θh)subscriptθh\\displaystyle\\log{\\left(\\theta_{h}\\right)}log ( italic_θ h )=home+atth+defa,absenthomesubscriptatthsubscriptdefa\\displaystyle=\\textrm{home}+\\textrm{att}_{h}+\\textrm{def}_{a},= home + att h + def a ,(10)log⁡(θa)subscriptθa\\displaystyle\\log{\\left(\\theta_{a}\\right)}log ( italic_θ a )=atta+defh.absentsubscriptattasubscriptdefh\\displaystyle=\\textrm{att}_{a}+\\textrm{def}_{h}.= att a + def h .(11)Each team has their own team-specific attack and defence ability,att and def respectively, which form the scoringintensities (θt)subscriptθt(\\theta_{t})( italic_θ t ) of the home and away teams. A constant homeeffect (home)home(\\textrm{home})( home ), which is assumed to be constant across allteams and across the time-span of the data, is also included in therate of the home team’s goals.For identifiability, we follow Baio and Blangiardo (2010) and Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003),and impose sum-to-zero constraints on the attack and defenceparameters∑t∈Tattt=0 and ∑t∈Tdeft=0,formulae-sequencesubscripttTsubscriptattt0andsubscripttTsubscriptdeft0\\sum_{t\\in T}\\textrm{att}_{t}=0\\qquad\\textrm{and}\\qquad\\sum_{t\\in T}\\textrm{%def}_{t}=0,∑ t ∈ T att t = 0 and ∑ t ∈ T def t = 0 ,where TTTitalic_T is the set of all teams to feature in the dataset.Furthermore, the attack and defence parameters for each team are seento be draws from a common distributionattt∼N⁢(μatt,σatt2) and deft∼N⁢(μdef,σdef2).formulae-sequencesimilar-tosubscriptatttNsubscriptμattsuperscriptsubscriptσatt2andsimilar-tosubscriptdeftNsubscriptμdefsuperscriptsubscriptσdef2\\textrm{att}_{t}\\sim N\\left(\\mu_{\\textrm{att}},\\sigma_{\\textrm{att}}^{2}\\right%)\\qquad\\textrm{and}\\qquad\\textrm{def}_{t}\\sim N\\left(\\mu_{\\textrm{def}},\\sigma%_{\\textrm{def}}^{2}\\right).att t ∼ N ( italic_μ att , italic_σ att 2 ) and def t ∼ N ( italic_μ def , italic_σ def 2 ) .We follow the prior set-up of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) and assume thathome follows a N⁢(0,1002)N0superscript1002N(0,100^{2})N ( 0 , 100 2 ) distributiona priori, with the hyper parameters having the priorsμatt∼N⁢(0,1002),similar-tosubscriptμattN0superscript1002\\displaystyle\\mu_{\\textrm{att}}\\sim N\\left(0,100^{2}\\right),italic_μ att ∼ N ( 0 , 100 2 ) ,μdef∼N⁢(0,1002),similar-tosubscriptμdefN0superscript1002\\displaystyle\\qquad\\mu_{\\textrm{def}}\\sim N\\left(0,100^{2}\\right),italic_μ def ∼ N ( 0 , 100 2 ) ,σatt∼I⁢n⁢v⁢-⁢G⁢a⁢m⁢m⁢a⁢(0.1,0.1),similar-tosubscriptσattInv-Gamma0.10.1\\displaystyle\\sigma_{\\textrm{att}}\\sim Inv\\textrm{-}Gamma(0.1,0.1),italic_σ att ∼ I n v - G a m m a ( 0.1 , 0.1 ) ,σdef∼I⁢n⁢v⁢-⁢G⁢a⁢m⁢m⁢a⁢(0.1,0.1).similar-tosubscriptσdefInv-Gamma0.10.1\\displaystyle\\qquad\\sigma_{\\textrm{def}}\\sim Inv\\textrm{-}Gamma(0.1,0.1).italic_σ def ∼ I n v - G a m m a ( 0.1 , 0.1 ) .A graphical representation of the model isgiven in figure 3.μattsubscriptμatt\\mu_{\\textrm{att}}italic_μ att σattsubscriptσatt\\sigma_{\\textrm{att}}italic_σ att μdefsubscriptμdef\\mu_{\\textrm{def}}italic_μ def σdefsubscriptσdef\\sigma_{\\textrm{def}}italic_σ def homeatthsubscriptatth\\textrm{att}_{h}att h defasubscriptdefa\\textrm{def}_{a}def a attasubscriptatta\\textrm{att}_{a}att a defhsubscriptdefh\\textrm{def}_{h}def h f⁢(Δ)hfsubscriptΔhf(\\Delta)_{h}f ( Δ ) h f⁢(Δ)afsubscriptΔaf(\\Delta)_{a}f ( Δ ) a θhsubscriptθh\\theta_{h}italic_θ h θasubscriptθa\\theta_{a}italic_θ a yhsubscriptyhy_{h}y h yasubscriptyay_{a}y a igure 3: Pictorial representation of the Bayesian hierarchical model.

This extension is also illustrated in figure 3.We fit both the baseline model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) and our extensionusing PyStan (Stan Development Team, 2016). We note that it may be desirableto fit both the model of Section 3.1 and the Bayesianhierarchical model concurrently. However, we find that in reality this isinfeasible as the latter can be fit using MCMC, whilst it is difficultto fit the model of Section 3.1 using MCMC due to the largenumber of parameters.4 ApplicationsHaving outlined our approach to determine a player’s ability in agiven event type, and offered an extension to the model ofBaio and Blangiardo (2010) to capture the goals scored in a specific fixture, wewish to test the proposed methods in real world scenarios. Wetherefore consider two applications. In the first we use data from the2013/2014 English Premier League to learn players abilities across theseason as a whole for a number of event types, including the abilityto score a goal. The second example concerns the number of goalsobserved in a given fixture, specifically, we predict whether acertain number of goals will be scored (or not) in each fixture.4.1 Determining a player’s abilityIn this section we consider the touch-by-touch data described inSection 2 and consider data for the 2013/2014 English PremierLeague season only. We look to create an ordering of playersabilities, from which we hope to extract meaning based on what we knowof the season. We also have data on the amount of time each playerspent on the pitch in each match and this information is factored inaccordingly through τi,ksubscriptτik\\tau_{i,k}italic_τ i , k . The season consisted of 380 matchesfor the 20 team league, with 544 different players used during matches.The teams are listed in table 4, with the final leaguetable shown in figure 4. From figure 4we note that Manchester City and Liverpool were the teams who scoredthe most goals, with Chelsea conceding the least. These teams did wellover the season and we expect players from these teams to have highabilities. The teams to do worst (and got relegated), were NorwichCity, Fulham and Cardiff; we do not expect players from these teams tofeature highly in any ordering created. A final note is that, in thisseason, Manchester United underperformed (given past seasons) undernew manager David Moyes.

This model set-up has 2182parameters governing any two interacting event types.

We found littledifference in results for alternative priors. We begin by consideringoccurrences of Goal and GoalStop. GoalStop is an event type of our owncreation (in conjunction with expert soccer analysts), made up ofmany other event types (BallRecovery, Challenge, Claim, Error,Interception, KeeperPickup, Punch, Save, Smother, Tackle), withBallRecovery being the event type where a player collects the ballafter it has gone loose. GoalStop aims to represent all the things ateam can do to stop the other team from scoring a goal.

Traceplots of the ELBO and a selection of model parameters are shown infigure 6. It is clear that convergence has been achieved(measured via the ELBO). For completeness the values of the fixed parameters(ψψ\\psiitalic_ψ) under the model are given in table 5, whereall respective parameters appear to be on the same scale. We observe smalldifferences in the parameters dictating the amount of impact both aplayer’s own team, and the opposing team has on occurrences of anevent type. There are more noticeable differences in the home effectsof each event type, with the home effect for Goal being much largerthan that of GoalStop. This is in line with other research around thegoals scored in a match, where a clear home effect is acknowledged,see Dixon and Coles (1997), Karlis and Ntzoufras (2003) and Baio and Blangiardo (2010) (amongstothers) for further discussion of this home effect. The home effect forGoalStop is closer to zero, suggesting the number of attempts a teammakes to stop a goal is similar whether they are playing at home oraway.Fixed parameterEvent type (eeeitalic_e)λ1esuperscriptsubscriptλ1e\\lambda_{1}^{e}italic_λ 1 e λ2esuperscriptsubscriptλ2e\\lambda_{2}^{e}italic_λ 2 e γesuperscriptγe\\gamma^{e}italic_γ e oal2.907×10-82.907superscript1082.907\\times 10^{-8}2.907 × 10 - 8 0.0410.165GoalStop1.621×10-71.621superscript1071.621\\times 10^{-7}1.621 × 10 - 7 0.0090.003Table 5: Values of the fixed parameters (ψψ\\psiitalic_ψ) for interacting event types Goal and GoalStop.Figure 7 shows the ηi,kesuperscriptsubscriptηike\\eta_{i,k}^{e}italic_η i , k e (2) we obtain when themodel parameters are combined for 2 randomly selected matches, where weset ΔiesuperscriptsubscriptΔie\\Delta_{i}^{e}Δ i e to be μΔiesubscriptμsuperscriptsubscriptΔie\\mu_{\\Delta_{i}^{e}}italic_μ Δ i e .

The solid line oneach plot separates the players from the two opposing teams. A largenumber of the model ηη\\etaitalic_ηs are close to the observed counts(especially for GoalStop), and nearly all observed values fall withinthe 95% prediction intervals, showing a reasonable model fit. Thenumber of goal-stops across teams is not particularly variable,however there is a suggestion of player variability (although this issomewhat clouded by the fact that substitutes are not specificallymarked, as we would expect them to register lower counts, by virtue ofless playing time).GoalGoalStopFigure 7: Within sample predictive distributions for the number of goals/goal-stops in the 2013/2014 English Premier League for 2 randomly selected matches.

This gives a Monte Carlo simulation ofeach player’s number of goals and goal-stops for each fixture in the2013/2014 English Premier League. Summing over theplayers who played in a given match, gives an in-sample prediction of thetotal number of goals/goal-stops for each team, in every fixture. Wepresent box-plots of these totals in figure 8, where forreference, we also include box-plots for each team’s total number ofgoals/goal-stops in each fixture constructed from the touch-by-touch data.The model is clearly capturing the patterns between differing teams(and the patterns observable within the data), especially for goal-stop. Theteams who scored the most goals over the season, Manchester City andLiverpool, have higher Goal box-plots than other teams, encompassing alarger range of goals scored. On the other hand, teams who scored fewgoals over the season, such as Norwich City, have thelowest box-plots, which cover a small range of goals scored in a match.Slightly surprisingly, there appears to be no connection between theoccurrences of GoalStop and the goals a team concedes, with bothChelsea and Norwich City having similar box-plots, despite conceding avastly different number of goals, 27 and 62 respectively. There issome suggestion that such observations may be used to determine ateam’s style of play, for example, whether they are a passingteam or follow the long ball philosophy; however, we leave suchquestions for future investigation given the set-up we derive here. Wecan conclude, nevertheless, that the model is capturing the trendsobserved in the touch-by-touch data well.ModelTouch-by-touch dataFigure 8: Box-plots of the total number of goals/goal-stops in a game for each team in the 2013/2014 English Premier League observed under the model and from the data. Top row Goal, bottom row GoalStop.Marginal posterior variational densities of Goal,q⁢(ΔiGoal)qsuperscriptsubscriptΔiGoalq(\\Delta_{i}^{\\textrm{Goal}})q ( Δ i Goal ), for two players are presented infigure 9, where q⁢(ΔiGoal)qsuperscriptsubscriptΔiGoalq(\\Delta_{i}^{\\textrm{Goal}})q ( Δ i Goal ) takesthe form of (6) and the prior is (16).The two players shown are Daniel Sturridge and Harrison Reed.Sturridge played 29 times over the season, totalling 2414 minutes ofmatch time, scoring 21 goals, whereas Reed played 4 times, totalling23 minutes, scoring zero goals. These attributes are clearly capturedby the posteriors; the greater number of observations for Sturridgeleading to a posterior with a much smaller variance. The high numberof goals scored by Sturridge leads to him having a higher value ofμΔiGoalsubscriptμsuperscriptsubscriptΔiGoal\\mu_{\\Delta_{i}^{\\textrm{Goal}}}italic_μ Δ i Goal (with reasonable certainty), whilstthe lack of both goals and playing time leads to a posterior for Reedwhich resembles the prior.SturridgeReedFigure 9: Marginal posterior variational densities of Goal for 2 players in the 2013/2014 English Premier League. Dashed prior, solid posterior.The model is clearly capturing differences between players abilities,as evidenced by the posteriors of figure 9. Thus, thenatural question to ask is whether these differences are sensible, and,if we were to order the players by their inferred ability, would thisordering agree with (a debatable) reality. Hence, we construct themarginal posterior variational densities for all players and rank themaccording to the 2.5% quantile of these densities. A top 10 for Goalis presented in table 6, with a ranking for GoalStopgiven in table 7. We present top 10 lists for otherevent types in Appendix B. The ranking shown intable 6 appears sensible, and comprises of those playerswho were the main goal scorers (strikers) for the best teams, and theplayers who scored nearly all the goals a lesser team scored over theseason. The ranking is very close to that obtained by ranking playerson the total number of goals scored over the season (although there issome debate in the soccer community as to whether this is a sensibleway of ranking, with some suggesting a ranking based on a per 90 minutestatistic, however, this can be distorted by those with very littleplaying time, see Chapter 3 of Anderson and Sally (2013) or AGR Analytics (2016) for further discussion).The questionable deviations from this ranking are Aguero(ranked third) and van Persie (ranked seventh). Both these players haveless playing time over the season compared to their competitors, andthus, the model highlights them as better goal scorers, given the timeavailable to them, than other players based on total goals scored.Expert soccer analysts agreed with this view when we showed themthese rankings. Suarez has an inferred ability much greater than any other player,which is evidenced by the 31 goals he scored (10 more than any otherplayer). At points the difference between successive ranks is small,suggesting some players are harder to distinguish between. Finally, wenote that the standard deviations for all players in the top 10 areroughly the same, meaning we have similar confidence in the abilityof any of these players.Goal - top 10RankPlayer2.5%MeanStandardObservedObservedRankTimequantiledeviationrankdifferenceplayed1Suarez0.5080.8690.184311031852Sturridge0.1760.6170.225212024143Aguero0.1470.6360.250174+116164Y.

Itfeatures 3 players with comparatively larger standard deviations,Kallstrom (rank 2), Lewis (rank 6) and Palacios (rank 7). Whilst theseplayers did well with the little playing time afforded to them, it issomewhat presumptuous to postulate that they would maintain a similarlevel of ability given more game time, leading to their ranking slipping.Unfortunately, this is a by product of inducing a ranking from the2.5% quantile — ideally we would provide several tables for eachevent type, filtering players by the amount of uncertainty surroundingthem, although such an approach would be unwieldy given the largenumber of players in the dataset. Moreover, fully factorised mean-fieldapproximations are known to underestimate the uncertainty of theposterior (Bishop, 2006). Although comparative uncertainty betweenplayers is easier to gauge, it is less clear how to quantify how muchbias is being added to the variances of each latent variableindividually. In a future work, this could be mitigated by adopting avariational approximation that accounts for some correlations of thelatent variables. However, the rest of the list appears sensible and ismade up mainly of defensive midfielders (whose main role it is todisrupt the oppositions play); only Mannone and Ruddy are goalkeepers(discounting the 3 players with large standard deviations). Thissuggests, that to stop a goal, it is more prudent to invest in a betterdefensive midfielder than it is a goalkeeper, presuming you can notjust buy the best player in each position. Here, the differencesbetween successive ranks are much smaller than in table 6,implying it is harder to distinguish between player ability to performgoal-stops than it is the ability to score goals.GoalStop - top 10RankPlayer2.5%MeanStandardObservedObservedRankTimequantiledeviationrankdifferenceplayed1Mulumbu2.5752.6530.0406311033192Kallstrom2.5532.9000.17733405+4031443Mannone2.5282.6150.04450812+927674Yacob2.5102.6140.05335943+3919795Tiote2.4742.5600.0445178+329886Lewis2.4462.8630.21323436+430987Palacios2.4412.6380.101100286+2795858Jedinak2.4202.5000.0416032-636519Ruddy2.4112.4910.0416003-6367910Arteta2.4092.5030.04843121+112615Table 7: Top 10 goal-stoppers in the 2013/2014 English Premier League based on the 2.5% quantile of the marginal posterior variational density for each player, q⁢(ΔiGoalStop)qsuperscriptsubscriptΔiGoalStopq(\\Delta_{i}^{\\textrm{GoalStop}})q ( Δ i GoalStop ).Overall though, the model provides a good fit to the data and suggestsa reasonable prowess to determine a player’s ability in a specificevent type, with marginal posterior variational densities providing agood visual comparison between different players abilities (and theconfidence surrounding that ability). In the next section we look toutilise these player abilities in the prediction of goals in a soccermatch.4.2 PredictionA key betting market, stemming from the rise of online betting, is theover/under market (Betfair, 2017; betHQ, 2017; SPORTINGINDEX, 2017),where people bet whether a certain number of goalswill (over) or won’t (under) be scored in a match. Here we attempt topredict whether 2.5 goals (a number of goals common with online betting)will be scored or not in a given fixture.To predict the goals scored in a fixture which takes place in thefuture we first fit the model on all the past available to us. Weuse a whole season of data to train themodel, before predicting the following season in incremental blocks.Here, we use the entirety of the 2013/2014 English Premier Leagueseason (380 fixtures) to train the model, before attempting to predictthe goals scored in each match of the 2014/2015 English Premier Leagueseason. We introduce the fixtures (on which we predict) in blocks ofsize 80, with a final block of 60 fixtures to total 380 (the number offixtures over a season). In each case we use all of the available pastto fit the model, that is, in predicting the second block of 80 fixtures inthe 2014/2015 season, we use all of the 2013/2014 season and the firstblock of the 2014/2015 season to fit the model. Figure 10shows a graphical representation of this approach.13/1414/15⋮ etcFigure 10: Illustration of the approach to prediction. The model is fit on all past data, before predictions are made for a future block of fixtures. Solid fit, dashed predict.For the extension to the model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) (which we considerto be the baseline model), we include the latent player abilities forthe event types Goal, Shots and ChainEvents, with their counterpartsbeing GoalStop, ShotStop and AntiPass respectively. Goal and GoalStopare as defined in Section 4.1, whilst Shots and ShotStophave homogeneous roots to Goal and GoalStop, that being the ability toshoot or to stop a shot. ChainEvents represents how prevalent a playeris in the lead up to a good attacking chance, with AntiPass being aplayer’s ability to stop the other team from passing the ball.

We found little difference when setting ΔiesuperscriptsubscriptΔie\\Delta_{i}^{e}Δ i e to be either μΔiesubscriptμsuperscriptsubscriptΔie\\mu_{\\Delta_{i}^{e}}italic_μ Δ i e or the 2.5% quantile ofq⁢(Δie)qsuperscriptsubscriptΔieq(\\Delta_{i}^{e})q ( Δ i e ) in (17) and (18),and so here report results for the mean (μΔiesubscriptμsuperscriptsubscriptΔie\\mu_{\\Delta_{i}^{e}}italic_μ Δ i e ).Both the models were fit using PyStan, and were run long enoughto yield a sample of approximately 10K independent posterior draws,after an initial burn in period. The teams which feature in the dataare those in table 4, with the addition of Burnley,Leicester City and Queens Park Rangers, who replaced the relegatedteams of Cardiff City, Fulham and Norwich City for the 2014/2015season. The set-up outlined at the beginning of this section allows us to view theevolution of a team’s attack/defence parameter or a player’s latentability through time after different fitting blocks. We denote block0 to be all the fixtures in the 2013/2014 English Premier Leagueseason, block 1 to be block 0 plus the first 80 fixtures of the2014/2015 season, block 2 to be block 1 plus the next 80 fixtures,block 3 to include the next 80 fixtures, with block 4 including thenext 80 fixtures again. The attack and defence parameters through timefor both the baseline model and the model including the latent playerabilities for selected teams are shown in figure 11, wherewe plot negative defence so that positive values indicate increasedability. Recall that these parameters for all teams must sum-to-zero.We see similar, but not identical, patterns under both models. Themodel including latent player abilities reduces the variance of theattack and defence parameters compared to the baseline model,suggesting the inclusion of the ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δs accounts for some of ateam’s attack and defensive ability. Manchester City and Chelsea followsimilar patterns under both models, with Chelsea clearly having thebest defence parameter. Including the ΔΔ\\Deltaroman_Δs impacts Liverpool’sattacking ability, where the removal of Suarez (Liverpool’s bestattacking player, who transferred to Barcelona between the 2013/2014and 2014/2015 seasons), clearly reduces Liverpool’s attacking threat ata more drastic rate than the baseline model. This is inline withreality, where Liverpool only scored 52 goals over the 2014/2015 seasoncompared to 101 goals the previous year. Cardiff City, who gotrelegated after the 2013/2014 season, but feature in all blocks despitenot being used for prediction (as fixtures involving them can informthe attack and defence abilities of other teams), have relativelyconstant parameters under both models, accounting for the reduction invariance. Notable for Burnley is the peak/trough observed afterblock 3; this is due to the fact that Burnley were starting to look atthe prospect of relegation and needed to start winning games, hence,they tried (and succeeded) to score more goals in order to win games,but found themselves more likely to concede goals in the process ofdoing so.BaselineIncluding latent player abilitiesFigure 11: Attack and defence parameters through time under the baseline model and the model including the latent player abilities for selected teams.

If a playerdoes not feature in a block we represent their ability by the mean ofthe prior distribution (-2). We see that the model isquick to identify a given player’s ability. To elucidate, Costa isimmediately (after block 1) identified as one of the top goal scorers,despite not featuring in the 2013/2014 season. The same can be said forSanchez, who takes longer to establish his ability after a lessimpressive start to the season. Aguero was one of the best goal scorersacross all the data and has a constant ability near the top. Kane hadlittle playing time until block 2 where the model starts to increasehis ability to score a goal. Defoe spent most of the 2013/2014 seasonon the bench before transferring to Toronto FC; he returned to theEnglish Premier League with Sunderland in January 2015, where he scoreda number of goals, saving Sunderland from relegation. The model rightlyacknowledges this and raises his ability as a goal scorer (a trait heis well known for). Given a player scores a small number of goals,relative to other event types, we include G. Johnson to show the effectof scoring a goal. Johnson scored 1 goal in the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015seasons (during block 2), and his ability rises by a large jump becauseof this; such jumps are not evident for players who score a reasonablenumber of goals (5+).Figure 12: The mean of q⁢(ΔiGoal)qsuperscriptsubscriptΔiGoalq(\\Delta_{i}^{\\textrm{Goal}})q ( Δ i Goal ) through time for a selection of players.

Control and Disruption comprise of theevent types listed in table 2. It is evident that forthe majority of players, their Control and Disruption abilities do notvary much through time (from block to block). This is perhapsunsurprising, given we do not expect a player’s ability to changedramatically from fixture to fixture. Those that vary the most are theplayers with fewer minutes played in the earlier blocks, but have muchmore playing time as time progresses, for example, Kane (seefigure 13). The figure does however show cleardistinction between players, with defenders tending to occupy the tophalf of the graph, and strikers the bottom half. An interestingextension to this work would be to see whether a clustering analysisof these latent player abilities would reveal player positions, that is,central defender or wing-back for example.Figure 13: The mean of q⁢(ΔiControl)qsuperscriptsubscriptΔiControlq(\\Delta_{i}^{\\textrm{Control}})q ( Δ i Control ) versus the mean of q⁢(ΔiDisruption)qsuperscriptsubscriptΔiDisruptionq(\\Delta_{i}^{\\textrm{Disruption}})q ( Δ i Disruption ) through time for a selection of players.

Our prediction blocks are formed of fixtures between teams wehave already seen in the previous (fitting) blocks, hence predictionblock 1 consists of 57 fixtures, prediction blocks 2-4 are made up of80 fixtures, with 60 fixtures in prediction block 5. We use apredicted starting line-up from expert soccer analysts to determine IkjsuperscriptsubscriptIkjI_{k}^{j}I k j ,the players who enter (17) and (18);these are usually quite accurate (86% accuracy over the season) andvary little from the players whostart a particular game. We then combine the θtsubscriptθt\\theta_{t}italic_θ t for the homeand away teams to give an overall scoring rate for each fixture,θ=θh+θaθsubscriptθhsubscriptθa\\theta=\\theta_{h}+\\theta_{a}italic_θ = italic_θ h + italic_θ a ,from which we calculate the probability of there being over 2.5 goals inthe match. We average these probabilities across the posterior sample.ROC curves based on these averaged probabilities, for each predictionblock, are presented in figure 14. For clarity we alsopresent the area under the curve (AUC) values in table 8.It is evident from both the figure and the table, that including thelatent player abilities in the model leads to a better predictiveperformance. We observe this increase across all blocks, although thedifference between the models in block 5 is severely reduced comparedto other blocks. The reasons for this reduction are twofold, the firstbeing that given a near full season of data (2014/2015) on which weare predicting, the baseline model can reasonably accurately capture ateam’s attack and defence parameters better than it can towards thestart of the season. Secondly the last block of a season tends to bemore volatile, as some teams try out younger players (who are notobserved in the data previously), and others have increased motivationto score more goals to try and win games, for example, to avoidrelegation. Whence, we observe similar behaviour under both models, aswe observe less players in a starting line-up, moving the modelincluding player abilities towards the baseline model. However, overall,we can conclude that the inclusion of the latent player abilities inthe model results in a better predictive performance throughout the2014/2015 season.Block 1Block 2Block 3Block 4Block 5Figure 14: ROC curves based on averaged probabilities for each prediction block.

Our approach is computationally efficient andcentres on variational inference methods. By adopting a Poisson modelfor occurrences of event types we are able to infer a player’s abilityfor a multitude of event types. These inferences are reasonablyaccurate and have close ties to reality, as seen inSection 4.1. Furthermore, our approach allows thevisualisation of differences between players, for a specific ability,through the marginal posterior variational densities.We also extended the Bayesian hierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010)to include these latent player abilities. Through this model wecaptured a team’s propensity to score goals, including a team’sattacking ability, defensive ability and accounting for a home effect.We used output from this model to predict whether 2.5 goals would bescored in a fixture or not, observing an improvement in performanceover the baseline model. A benefit of the prediction approach (and theblock structure we implemented), is that, it allowed us to see how ourinference about a playerâs ability evolved through time, explicitlyhighlighting what impact fringe players can have when they start gettingregular playing time, for example, Kane in Section 4.2.We plan three major ways of extending the current work. First, weintend to extend the variational approximation to allow for dependencyamong the latent abilities in the posterior. Allowing for correlationsin q⁢(⋅)q⋅q(\\cdot)q ( ⋅ ) will let the model infer higher posterior variances, resultingin a more robust ranking of players, and possibly improved predictivepower for tasks such as providing probabilities on the number of goalsin a future match. From a modelling perspective, an extension is tolet abilities change over time using a random walk across seasons andwithin seasons, which will be particularly useful when a substantialnumber of years of historical touch-by-touch data eventually becomesavailable. Finally, as the model gets applied to more competitionssimultaneously, it will be important to propose ways of scaling upthe procedure. A topic worth investigating is how to best iterativelysubsample the data for stochastic optimisation of the variationalobjective function.Appendix A Closed-form expression for the ELBORecall the ELBO of Section 3.1 (4) is available inclosed-form.

All 4 event types are of our own creation, made up ofmany other event types.• Shots: Goal, MissedShots, SavedShot, ShotOnPost.• ShotStop: Challenge, Claim, Interception, KeeperPickup,Punch, Save, Smother, Tackle.• AntiPass: BallRecovery, BlockedPass, Claim, Clearance,CornerAwarded, CrossNotClaimed, Interception, KeeperPickup,OffsideProvoked, Punch, Smother, Tackle.Goal features in Shots, as a successful shot on target leads to a goal,unless it becomes a SavedShot. ChainEvents is created by counting thenumber of instances a player is involved in the last 5 successfulevents leading to an event type contained within Shots, that is, thenumber of times a player is involved in a chain leading to a goodattacking chance. The last 5 events were chosen as the length of thechain after discussion with expert soccer analysts, who thought thatany further events back from the chance would have had little impactin creating it.The top 10 for Shots consists entirely of strikers, the person seen asthe main scorer of goals in a team, and thus, the person likely to havethe most shots. The ranking appears sensible, with the playersheightened in our ranking (Aguero, Kane, Jovetic and A. Carroll),playing less time over the season due to injury, or mainly featuringas a substitute. The model suggests they took a large number of shotswith the limited time they played. Suarez has an ability greater thanany other player by a reasonable amount, which is expected givenhe had nearly 70 more shots than anyone else over the season. Over the2013/2014 English Premier League season Suarez was regarded as thebest player, winning many awards, it is therefore unsurprising that hefeatures highly in many of the top 10 rankings.The ranking for ShotStop is made up completely from goalkeepers, anatural conclusion given the event type. Lewis tops the ranking,although he only played 1 game and has a much larger standard deviationthan anyone else. The goalkeepers for Fulham (Stockdale andStekelenburg) played roughly half the season each, both stopping shotswell (and at a similar level) when playing, for this reason theyfeature higher in our rankings than the observed order (determined bythe total shots stopped over the season) suggests.The top 10 for ChainEvents is similar in ways to that of GoalStop(table 6). It features a number of players with lessplaying time and therefore larger standard deviations. Whilst most ofthese players play a reasonable amount of time, from which to drawconclusions about their ability, the obvious outlier is Teixeira whoplayed only 14 minutes (and has a very large standard deviation,comparatively). Again Suarez features highly in the rankings. The top10 contains the creative players for each team, with thatplayer for the top teams all featuring, Silva - Manchester City,Coutinho - Liverpool, Hazard - Chelsea. When we showed this ranking toexpert soccer analysts there was a consensus that the ordering madesense (with the obvious exception of Teixeira).The ranking for AntiPass consists of both defenders and defensivemidfielders, both types of player whose job it is to disrupt play. Alcarazand Kallstrom have comparatively larger standard deviations, but theremainder of the ranking appears sensible. The difference betweensuccessive rankings is small, and there is some suggestion that it iseasier to distinguish between player attacking ability than playerdefensive ability (GoalStop, ShotStop, AntiPass). This would agree withsome in the soccer community who view attacking as an individualability, whereas defending is more of a team ability. Overall, all 4of the rankings presented in this appendix appear largely sensible,and agree with expert soccer analysts views.Shots - top 10RankPlayer2.5%MeanStandardObservedObservedRankTimequantiledeviationrankdifferenceplayed1Suarez1.4261.5710.0741811031852Aguero1.2691.4810.1088612+1016163Dzeko1.2201.4140.0991035+221284Kane1.0381.4130.19128126+1225495Bony1.0361.2250.0961083-226446Sturridge1.0351.2330.101999+324147Jovetic1.0271.4410.21123150+1434408Remy0.9981.2060.1069011+322749A.
